            This is a free textbook teaching introductory statistics for undergraduates in Psychology. 
            This textbook is part of a larger OER course package for teaching undergraduate statistics 
            in Psychology, including this textbook, a lab manual, and a course website. All of the 
            materials are free and copiable, with source code maintained in Github repositories.

            This textbook was written in R-Studio, using R Markdown, and compiled into a web-book format 
            using the bookdown package. In general, I thank the larger R community for all of the amazing 
            tools they made, and for making those tools open, so that I could use them to make this thing.

            In principle, anybody could fork or otherwise download this repository. Load the Rproj file in

          <p>
            Why write another statistics textbook, aren't there already loads of those? Yes, there are. 
            We had a couple reasons. First, we would like to make R more accessible for the undergraduate 
            population, and we wrote this textbook around the capabilities of R. The textbook was written 
            entirely in R-Studio, and most of the examples have associated R-code. R is not much of a focus 
            in the textbook, but there is an introduction to using R to solve data-analysis problems in the 
            lab manual. Many instructors still use SPSS, Excel, or newer free GUIs like JAMOVI, so we also 
            made lab exercises for each of those as well.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            This is a mildly opinionated, non-traditional introduction to statistics. It acknowledges some 
            of the major ideas from traditional frequentist approaches, and some Bayesian approaches. Much 
            of the conceptual foundation is rooted in simulations that can be conducted in R. We use some 
            formulas, but mostly explain things without formulas. The textbook was written with math-phobia 
            in mind, and attempts to reduce the phobia associated with arithmetic computations. There are 
            many things missing that should probably be added. We will do our best to add necessary things 
            as we update the textbook.
